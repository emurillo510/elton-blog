I feel like this blog is helping me keep focus and productive. So I am going to continue writing this. By writing out what I want to accomplish this blog is kind of like a warm up on
on tackling my day. Let's see how long I can do it!

# Learning Statistics and R

Lately I've been reading Practical Data Science With R and R in Action.

I've been trying to deep dive in learning the basics about the R ecosystem and statistics because this is what I personally
want to learn.

# Learning Docker

Since we are in lockdown I might as well level up my skills. By learning docker I become more attractive in the market place and I start 
deploying a project in a large scale.

# Starting a football application.

Time and time again, I start on a project, but never finish. What I am going to do with this project is a build a database for football
statistics for individual players.

I can scale this out for stocks later on. This will tie in with the other thing I am learning (statistics).

Hopefully, I can keep up writing these journals!
