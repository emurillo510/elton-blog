# Getting into Flow

It's been staying home all day due to the coronavirus. I need to find a job and work on projects to pass the time, but I don't want to stay
infront of the computer all day. But it simply has to be done. I need to just sit tight and get to work.

# List of things I need todo

- stay fresh with leetcode questions

I don't think anyone loves doing leetcode problems, but it's the convention for software engineering interview process. I have to stay sharp!
But I am facing dilemma between collecting simulus checks and just independent learning or going back to the workforce. The government is
not incentivizing us going back to work, why not further my skills rather than rushing into it?

- work on a side-project i'd actually want to use

I have to work something on my freetime rather than just learning. I need to start a project and stay fresh incode.

- exercise

I need to keep this up to feel healthy. Being in front of the computer and phone all day is extremely bad. I need some sort of physical activity.

I feel like there is only so many hours in a day and it is going by so fast! I need to slow it down. In order to do that I need to get into some sort of flow. By consistently writing blog entries I think I can stay productive.
