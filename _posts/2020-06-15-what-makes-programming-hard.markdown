There is a common image of programmers wearing hoodies, drinking coffee and living the life in Silicon Valley.
They sit in front of computers in cushy jobs. But in reality it is so much more different. Programming is a demanding job.

flaws!

- Patience. If you go guns blazing you get shot first.
- Focus. if you aren't focused you will not be productive.
- Unforgiving. if you aren't detail oriented code doesn't work.
- Knowledge. There are so many topics to study it's unless.
- Practice. If you aren't constantly coding you will lose your skill and you need to start the process over.

# All the positives of programming outweigh the bad!
