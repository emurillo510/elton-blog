I am starting up a blog again to pump up my productivity and organize my thoughts.

# What to focus on?

- bitcoin
- stocks
- statistics

# bitcoin
The topics above are what I would like to focus on as a hobby. I am a bitcoin hodler(bitcoiners know what I mean). I am not quite sure how deep I want to get into learning the protocol. I need to question myself if it's really something I am passionate about. I am for sure passionate about it being used as a store-of-value.

# stocks
Stocks on the other hand is something I really enjoy doing. I love doing research on companies and figuring out future innovations and investments. I wonder if I can do this day-to-day and
become an employer for myself.

I need to improve upon understanding macroeconomics and polish up my company evaluation strategies.

# statistics
Statistics is a topic I've always wanted to learn and I have been slowly learning. Learning this will help complement my passion.

# Getting a new job

I need to stay consistent and some how make finding a job a fun event. It's tough. I need to keep github up-to-date and work on projects worth showcasing... Staying home all day in semi-lockdown is tough, but needs to be done. I need to buy more bitcoin!

# Simplification

I read somewhere we live in an overbundance world. We can get what we what at anytime. We can just order things on Amazon or look something on Google, or pop up Youtube. Life is simply
too efficient. Over efficiency is actually bad for our dopamine because of biological factors it messes up with our pleasure sensories. This leads to less focus and over fatigue. I need to simplify shit and it needs to start now. Less rushing and better quality.

less periodically looking at your phone again, this goes back to the idea above.

# Better Coding

I need to do more leetcoding problems. I think I haven't been doing them because they are mentally draining and overwhelming. There are so many leetcode problems...
I need to put less stress on myself on completing them and just do them. Exposure is important to progress. I should also aim for focus.

# Exercise

Again and again it's been said the importance of exercising.
I need to start exercising because the body helps the mind think. It works as one. When you don't exercise you simply don't feel the same.
By exercising, long story short you help balance your mind and body. This leads to increased productivity.



That's about it for my first post!
